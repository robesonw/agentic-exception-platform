# Final Test Report

## Status
After multiple attempts, the colon prefix issue persists. The catalog file cleaning was attempted but exceptions still show colon prefixes.

## Test Results
❌ **FAILURE**: Exception types still have colon prefixes

## Next Steps Needed
1. Verify the catalog file is actually being cleaned
2. Verify the container is using the cleaned catalog
3. Check if there are multiple sources of exception types
4. Verify normalization code is actually being executed
